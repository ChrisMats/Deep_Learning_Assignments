# Deep_Learning_Assignments
The repo for Deep Learning assignments from KTH's course at T17

Assignment 1: One layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

Assignment 2: Two layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

Assignment 3: k-layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

Assignment 4: RNN to synthesize English text character by character

EXTRA: Lab 1 (Feed forward networks: The delta rule and Back Propagation) from the ANN course which shows the difference of a linear and a non linear classifier on different types of data data. It also includes some regression and encoders problems
